Run a Codex code review as a background task. Execute:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="${user_config.openrouter_api_key}" codex exec review -c 'model_provider="openrouter"' --uncommitted
```

Add `-c 'model="${user_config.model}"'` if a model is configured, and `-c 'model_reasoning_effort="${user_config.effort}"'` if effort is configured.

When the review completes, assess the findings and inform the user of any issues found.
