Delegate a task to Codex. Run as a background task:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="${user_config.openrouter_api_key}" codex exec -c 'model_provider="openrouter"' "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Add `-c 'model="${user_config.model}"'` if a model is configured.

Describe what you're stuck on, what you've tried, and what you need Codex to help with. When Codex responds, present the output faithfully without filtering or second-guessing. Do not auto-apply any suggestions — ask the user which actions to take.
